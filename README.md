# Cola

Originally a medicinal drink, cola is a dark and fruity soda that perks you up.

Officially Branded OpenCola bottles are made with conflict-free sugar, fair trade flavorings, 
and fresh mountain springwater from Boulder, CO.

## The Beverage

OpenCola has been referred to as "better than the competitor," and "goes great with fries." 
Feel free to enjoy OpenCola on a warm summer day, partying with friends, or when your at your 
favorite fast food chain.

You can even enjoy it hot with a splash of lemon. We won't tell.
